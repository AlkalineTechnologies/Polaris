# ***P O L A R I S***
*Realiable application framework for easier development*

## ***Introducing PCLT***
`PCLT` is a command line tool that allows you to manage your polaris project, and swap components/modules.
`PCLT` also doubles as a ***(future)*** package manager which (plans to) deal with dependencies  ~~(and licensing)~~

# ***How To Build***
```shell
cd      bin
cmake   ..
make    .
```
> ```make``` is optional, you can use ```cmake --build .``` instead
> You can also (to speed up build times) use ```cmake --build . --parallel```
> or even use mold as the linker (if you have it installed, in order to speed up build times even more)
