***An framework for everyone! where your imagination is the limit.***



## Planned features
+ A multi purpose engine built for making more than just games, with the goal of full modularity, and the ability to cater to what developers want/need.
+ Built on C++20 with multiple language support (in form of the wrappers) planned.
+ Cross platfrom development. Export your games to Windows, GNU/Linux, and MacOS
+ Vulkan support.
+ And much more!


## About
Polaris is a game engine designed to have little limitations, but not be too cumbursome on a new user.
