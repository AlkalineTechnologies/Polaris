# Polaris ships with the Polaris/Project CommandLine Tool    (PCLT) 
# PCLT is and can be used for component/management (package manager), and for packing/building/shipping modules, as well as swapping
# components/modules, after packaging, you can upload you modules to the polaris repo (Under future development)



HIERARCHY FOR MODULES:

Engine:
  |
  |-- Component:
  |---- Module:
  |------- [binaries]
  |------- [source dirs]
  |---- [Headers]


########## Example for project hierarchy in autogenerated polaris projects ##########


Project:
  |- Polaris:                         # [auto generated]
  |-- Window:                         # [Component class]
  |----- GLFW:                        # [generated by module]
  |-------- [CONTENTS/BINARIES]       # [generated with module]
  |----- [Headers]                    # [generated with module class]
  |- ...                              # [user generated structure]
  |- Modules.pcfg                     # [auto generated]
  |- Config.pcfg                      # [auto generated]



# Components are a broader class of Modules
# for example, A window manager is a component, but glfw or sdl would be a module
# the point of this system is for being able to swap modules (through the use of PCLT )
